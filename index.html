            <h2>Info</h2>
            <p>Squirtle is one of the Kanto Starters from Generation one of the Pokemon Franchise. It is the water type starter and evolves into Wartortle, then Blastoise. 
                Squirtle is said to be able to shoot water from its mouth. Its final evolution is very defensive and a true tank. He's really cute and a great starter choice for the Gen 1 Games. Squirtle, being a water type also has two 
                primary weaknesses which are grass and electric. however, it shouldn't be to hard to find a good pokemon to combat these weaknesses.

            <!-- Gym Advantages -->
            <h2>Gym Advantages</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Water Type advantage gives you an early start in the Gen 1 Games</li>
                <li>Once you get past the electric and grass type gyms, which are next to each other in order, it will be smooth sailing from there</li>
                <li>Blastoise will be good for end game since the last two gyms are fire and ground.</li>
            </ol>
